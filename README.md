# Introduction
This is a VicRoads project. As you may know, sensors are installed along our freeways. These sensors capture data about passing traffic such as speed, volume and lane occupancy. This project need identify a crash from this sensor data. Such identification will enable VicRoads to take appropriate action quickly. That is, after identifying such events, VicRoadsâ€™ Incident Response Service can clear incidents and help maintain traffic flow
