3. Teamwork Contract  In this signed agreement, it should contain

GOALS: What are our team goals for this project? What do we want to accomplish? What skills do we want to develop or refine?
Expectations and procedures (ground rules)  procedures in place for encouraging discussion, coming to resolution without becoming repetitive, and resolving differences of opinion. For example,  what do we expect of one another in regard to attendance at meetings, participation, frequency of communication, procedures to encourage discussion and to complete work by agreed dates etc. The contract should focus those behaviours that are crucial to the group's effectiveness.
CONSEQUENCES: How will we address non-performance in regard to these goals, expectations, policies and procedures?
Each group member  to sign, indicating their agreement to the contract.
Single student project is also required to submit a teamwork contract to show how you will work with other (external) team members and industry supervisor.
